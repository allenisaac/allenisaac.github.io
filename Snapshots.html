				Practitioner Snapshots
				</div>
				<div class='description'>
				<p>The dashboard at the bottom of the page was created for a medical group to give practitioners a "snapshot" of how they're performing on various quality and productivity measures.  In this version, the users and measures have been removed, there are only 12 months of data included, 
				and the data has been changed slightly to remove company specific information. </p>
				<p>
				The major difficulty in this project was making it useful for a wide range of users.  There are those who are interested are interested in looking at their data, figuring out what has been happening and how they may be able to improve, and then there are others that may only look at this a few times every year.
				This dashboard aims to have a simply, easy to view layout that provides additional detail for those willing to look.  The dashboard contains a table, which had been used prior to the dashboard, where all the information is laid out plainly.  To the right, there is a horizontal bar graph that allows users to quickly
				see how well they're doing on their quarterly goals, which for many users, is all they're interested in.  The layout here is fairly simple, so they can see if they are above, at, or below their goals.
				</p>
				<p>
				At the bottom, there is a line graph and box and whisker plot so users can easily compare themselves to their colleagues and view their progress over time.  There are some subtleties here that allow for a more indepth look at the data, without taking away from the simplistic view.  Hovering over the line graph gives
				exact information, so users don't have to switch between months to see how they're doing.  Also, the month points on the line have a radius proportional to the number of patients seen, so any major changes attributed to a change in sample size can be quickly noticed.  The transparent lines in the back represent 
				colleagues from the same specialty, so company wide trends can be seen, without adding too much visual clutter.  In addition, measures in the table and horizontal bar graph can be clicked to change the measure quickly.
				</p>
				<p>
				The way the dashboard loads, adding new measures and users is a very simple task.  In most cases, all it requires is adding them to the appropriate references and choosing a format option.  This is due to the fact that the visualizations are close to being reusable charts, as outlined in the attached link.
